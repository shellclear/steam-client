pcie_aspm=      [PCIE] Forcibly enable or disable PCIe Active State Power
                 Management.
         off     Disable ASPM.
         force   Enable ASPM even on devices that claim not to support it.
                 WARNING: Forcing ASPM on may cause system lockups.

 intel_iommu=    [DMAR] Intel IOMMU driver (DMAR) option
         on
                 Enable intel iommu driver.
         off
                 Disable intel iommu driver.
         igfx_off [Default Off]
                 By default, gfx is mapped as normal device. If a gfx
                 device has a dedicated DMAR unit, the DMAR unit is
                 bypassed by not enabling DMAR with this option. In
                 this case, gfx device will use physical address for
                 DMA.
         forcedac [x86_64]
                 With this option iommu will not optimize to look
                 for io virtual address below 32-bit forcing dual
                 address cycle on pci bus for cards supporting greater
                 than 32-bit addressing. The default is to look
                 for translation below 32-bit and if not available
                 then look in the higher range.
         strict [Default Off]
                 With this option on every unmap_single operation will
                 result in a hardware IOTLB flush operation as opposed
                 to batching them for performance.
         sp_off [Default Off]
                 By default, super page will be supported if Intel IOMMU
                 has the capability. With this option, super page will
                 not be supported.
         ecs_off [Default Off]
                 By default, extended context tables will be supported if
                 the hardware advertises that it has support both for the
                 extended tables themselves, and also PASID support. With
                 this option set, extended tables will not be used even
                 on hardware which claims to support them.
         tboot_noforce [Default Off]
                 Do not force the Intel IOMMU enabled under tboot.
                 By default, tboot will force Intel IOMMU on, which
                 could harm performance of some high-throughput
                 devices like 40GBit network cards, even if identity
                 mapping is enabled.
                 Note that using this option lowers the security
                 provided by tboot because it makes the system
                 vulnerable to DMA attacks.
